sudo apt-get install the following...

python-matplotlib
## needed for doing graphing
python-numpy
## lets face it, reality pretty much depends on np
python-scipy
## used for the curve fitting that slaps a gaussian/exponential on our 
## histograms
##
## probably going to be used elsewhere a lot with scipy.stats and other
## things
python-requests
## used by the web scraper to acquire our data from the web
python-pygit2
## just a nice touch in the scrap console that shows what the current git branch
## is
python-pandas
python-seaborn
## these are awesome voodoo that seem to work with matplotlib to
## generate really complex plots that would otherwise be really
## hard to do
##
## also lots of useful statistical tools
##
## check out
## http://python-for-multivariate-analysis.readthedocs.io/a_little_book_of_python_for_multivariate_analysis.html
## for more info
python-bs4
## for beautiful soup

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
## Seaborn needs to be installed via pip now to get the right version that can
## create a heatmap
##
## the apt version is behind by a version or 4
